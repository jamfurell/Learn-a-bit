## Introduction

Joined #MintBean in their [Learn-a-bit challenge](https://mintbean.io/meets/97109cbb-58fa-4ee6-9033-1d0aade186fc). For this solo challenge, we were given design components of a webpage with a [style guide](https://github.com/Mintbean/Learn-a-bit) and had to recreate the header of a landing webpage only using **Vanilla** #HTML, #CSS, and #Javascript.

## Outcome
Through this challenge, I got to build a mobile hamburger menu both using only CSS and CSS with Javascript. I also gained a better understanding of using CSS and Javascript for DOM manipulation and improving user interface. 
Special Thanks to [Mintbean](https://mintbean.io/) for this opportunity!
